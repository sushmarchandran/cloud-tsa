# Using Cloud TSA with your application

The configuration for Cloud TSA includes the `Prometheus end-point`, your `application metrics` which will be pulled from the Prometheus end-point, and the `time series detectors` which will analyze them.

Using Cloud TSA with your application involves four steps:

1. Connecting your `Cloud TSA` and `Prometheus` services with each other
2. Telling the `Cloud TSA` service about the metrics in Prometheus which you want to analyze
3. Telling the `Cloud TSA` service about time series detectors which you want to use for their analysis
4. Visualizing `Cloud TSA` alerts in Prometheus and Grafana
